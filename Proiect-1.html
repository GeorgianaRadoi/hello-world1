              <p class="big-text">Photography.
                  Emotion and Happiness
              </p>
              <p> Since I found photography two and a half years ago I have learned different things which I would like to share with you today. These lessons have made me richer and I hope that you will find them refreshing and inspiring on your journey with the camera, too.
                1. Never do photography to become a rock-star.
                2. Enjoy what you are shooting.
                3. Prepare well for your shooting, realizing that your battery isn’t charge when you’re setting up for that sunrise shoot is too late!
                4. Always take one warm garment more than you actually need with you
                5. Pay attention to your thoughts and emotions while you are shooting
                6. Set goals you can achieve
                7. Write tips about photography, because writing is also learning
                8. Never go shooting without a tripod
                9. Be pleased with the little successes
                10. Build relationships with potential photo buddies 11. Watch the place you want to shoot first with your heart… and then with the camera
                12. Always stay calm
                13. Know that you tend to overestimate yourself
                14. Perspective is the killer
                15. Dedicate yourself to photography, but never browbeat yourself too much
                16. Take part in a photography community 17. Keep your camera clean
                18. Never compare yourself to others in a better or worse context
                19. Find your own style of photography
                20. Try to compose more and to hit the shutter less
                21. Seek out and learn to accept critique on your images
                22. Do something different to recover creativity
                23. Get inspiration from the work of other photographers
                24. Criticize honestly but respectfully
                25. Get feedback from your lady
                26. Don’t copy other photographer’s style
                27. Be bold
                28. Take care of the golden ratio
                29. 10mm rocks!
                30. Take self portraits
                31. Read books about photography
                32. To give a landscape photograph the extra boost, integrate a person (maybe yourself)
                33. Every shooting situation is different than you expect
                34. Pay attention to s-curves and lines
                35. Always shoot in RAW

                <h1>How Harry Gruyaert Makes You Fall In Love </h1>
                <p>The most difficult thing is to make photos where you live, because you start to find things normal. For my very long work about Belgium I had the advantage traveling back and forth. I realized that I often made my best photos in the beginning. After a while you start to think everything is normal</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>I am a photographer, but I think of photography like therapy. It’s something I need to do. If I don’t take pictures a month, I really miss it. Its relationship to the world I need…. Photography that matters most to me comes from this urgent personal need</p>
